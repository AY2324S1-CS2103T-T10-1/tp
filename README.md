* This is **TA(Teaching Assistant) Management app for NUS(National University of Singapore) SOC(School of Computing) professors**.<br>
  Example usages:
  * Access TA's contact details and availability for relief classes
  * Track TA's renumeration details
* The project builds on a brownfield software project called _AddressBook_ used for managing contact details.
  * It is **written in OOP fashion**. It provides a **reasonably well-written** code base **bigger** (around 6 KLoC) than what students usually write in beginner-level SE modules, without being overwhelmingly big.
  * It comes with a **reasonable level of user and developer documentation**.
  * For detailed documentation of this project, see the **[Address Book Product Website](https://se-education.org/addressbook-level3)**.
* It is named `TAManager` (`TAM` for short) because it was intended for easy management of TAs.

* This project is a **part of the se-education.org** initiative. If you would like to contribute code to this project, see [se-education.org](https://se-education.org#https://se-education.org/#contributing) for more info.
