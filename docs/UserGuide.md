## Quick Start

1. Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed on your computer.

2. Download the latest `TAManager.jar` from [here](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T10-1/tp/releases).

3. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your Teaching Assistant Manager.

4. Open a command terminal, `cd` into the folder where you placed the jar file, and use the `java -jar TAManager.jar` command to run the application.
   A GUI similar to the one below should appear in a few seconds. Note how the app contains some sample data.
   ![UI](images/Ui.png)

5. Type the command in the command box and press Enter to execute it. For example, typing `help` and pressing Enter will open the help window.
   Here are some example commands you can try:

   - `list`: Lists all teaching assistants.
   - `add n/Snowball p/98765432 e/snowball@example.com tele/@snowball t/fulltime c/CS1231S h/10`: Adds a teaching assistant named Snowball to the list.
   - `delete 3`: Deletes the 3rd teaching assistant shown in the current list.
   - `clear`: Deletes all teaching assistants.
   - `exit`: Exits the app.

6. Refer to the following sections below for details on each command.

## Command Format

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g. `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `â€¦`â€‹ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]â€¦â€‹` can be used as `Â ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.

You can view the list of all teaching assistants in TAManager.

Format: `list`

*<center>TAManager shows you the full list of teaching assistants.</center>*


<div markdown="block" class="command-succeed">
<div class="alert alert-success">
:heavy_check_mark: When the command succeeds:

```
</div>

### Finding a Teaching Assistant: `find`

You can find specific teaching assistants using various search parameters.

Format: `find [n/NAME] [c/COURSE_CODE] [d/DAY from/FROM to/TO]`

- You can search by name, course or free time, using the prefixes `n/`, `c/` or `d/ from/ to/` respectively.
- The name prefix `n/` allows for multiple keywords to be used, separated by spaces. e.g. `find n/Alex Bernice` will give you all TAs who have either "Alex" or "Bernice" in their names.
- The course prefix `c/` and free time prefixes `d/ from/ to/` allows for one keyword to be used for each prefix.  e.g. `find c/CS2103T` or `find d/1 from/10:00 to/12:00`.
- To search by the free time field, all three prefixes `d/ from/ to/` must be present and all respective parameters need to be correctly given.
- The search is case-insensitive. e.g. `alex` will match `Alex`, `cs1231s` will match `CS1231S`.
- Only full words will be matched e.g. `Alex` will not match `Alexis`, `cs1231` will not match `cs1231s`.
- You can apply multiple search filters to narrow down the search results, through including multiple filters in
  one command.
- Teaching assistants matching all the search parameters will be returned.
- The search filters are applied to the full list of TAs, not the displayed list of TAs.

Examples:

- `find n/Alex` returns all teaching assistants whose names contain `alex` (e.g. `Alex Yeoh`).
- `find c/cs1231s` returns all teaching assistants that are teaching `cs1231s`.
- `find d/1 from/10:00 to/12:00` returns all teaching assistants that are free on `Monday` from `10:00` to `12:00`.
- `find n/Alex c/cs1231s` returns all teaching assistants whose names contain `alex` and are teaching `cs1231s`.
- `find c/cs2103t d/1 from/10:00 to/12:00` returns all teaching assistants who are teaching `cs2103t` and are free on `Monday` from `10:00` to `12:00`.

### Removing a Teaching Assistant: `delete`

You can remove a specified teaching assistant from TAManager.

Format: `delete INDEX`

- Deletes the teaching assistant at the specified `INDEX`.
- The index refers to the index number shown in the displayed TA list.
- The index must be a positive integer (1, 2, 3, ...).

Examples:

- [`list`](#viewing-teaching-assistants-list) followed by `delete 2` deletes the 2nd teaching assistant in the address book.
- `find n/Betsy` followed by `delete 1` deletes the 1st teaching assistant in the results of the [`find`](#finding-a-teaching-assistant-find) command.

| `The person index provided is invalid` | Ensure that `INDEX` corresponds to a TA in the list       |

</div>

### Updating Hours for Teaching Assistants: `hour`

You can add hours to all teaching assistants in the current list.

Format: `hour HOUR`

- This command updates the hour field for all TAs in the currently displayed list, by adding the `HOUR` value to their current values. This `HOUR` value can be both negative and positive.
- This command can be applied after the [`find`](#finding-a-teaching-assistant-find) command. e.g. First type `find c/ CS2103T` will find all TAs with course
`CS2103T`, then type `hour 6` will add 6 hours to all `CS2103T` TAs only, other TAs will not be updated.
- The resulting working hour after updating should still be within range of 0-9999.

Examples:

- `hour 4` will add 4 hours to all TAs in the address book.
- `find c/CS1231S` then `hour 4` will add 4 hours to all `CS1231S` TAs and other TAs will not be affected.

|---------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| `Invalid command format!` | Ensure that `HOUR` is present and is between 0 and 9999 |

</div>

### Editing free time of a Teaching Assistant: `editft`

You can edit the free time of a specific teaching assistant on a specified day.

Format: `editft INDEX d/DAY from/FROM to/TO`

- `DAY` should be between 1 and 5, inclusive
- `FROM` and `TO` should be in "HH:mm" format
- `FROM` should be before `TO`

Examples:

- `editft 1 d/2 from/13:00 to/15:00` will update the free time of the TA with index 1 by setting his free time on Tuesday to be 13:00 to 15:00.

![update Hour](images/editFreeTime.png)

## Course Management Commands

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about courses:**<br>
- At the moment, TAManager does not support adding course to the course list.

- Advanced users can edit the course list directly by editing the `courses.json` file.
</div>

### Viewing course information : `course`

You can view the information for a specific course and its tutorial timings.

Format: `course c/COURSE_CODE`

- COURSE_CODE should start with 2-3 alphabets, followed by 4 numbers, and optionally end with an alphabet. Needs to be an existing course.

Example: `course c/CS2103T` returns the course information and tutorial timings for CS2103T.

</div>

### Adding a default course : `teach`

You can add a default course to TAManager. The default course is the course that you are currently managing or teaching. This is useful when you only want to view TAs that are teaching your default course.

Format: `teach c/COURSE_CODE`

- COURSE_CODE should start with 2-3 alphabets, followed by 4 numbers, and optionally end with an alphabet. Needs to be an existing course.

Expected outcome:
- Updates the name of the window with the default course.
- Filters the list of TAs teaching under the course automatically.
- The default course is saved even after you close the application.
- The next time you open the application, the list of TAs will be automatically filtered based on your default course.

Example: `teach c/CS2103T` sets the default course to the course CS2103T.

### Reset the default course : `clearteach`

You can reset the default course in TAManager.

This will revert the changes made by the [`teach`](#adding-a-default-course--teach) command.

If no default course is set, the command will execute successfully but nothing will happen.

Example: `clearteach`
