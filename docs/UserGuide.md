## Quick Start

1. Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed on your computer.

2. Download the latest `TAManager.jar` from [here](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T10-1/tp/releases).

3. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your Teaching Assistant Manager.

4. Open a command terminal, `cd` into the folder where you placed the jar file, and use the `java -jar TAManager.jar` command to run the application.
   A GUI similar to the one below should appear in a few seconds. Note how the app contains some sample data.
   ![UI](images/Ui.png)

5. Type the command in the command box and press Enter to execute it. For example, typing `help` and pressing Enter will open the help window.
   Here are some example commands you can try:

   - `list`: Lists all teaching assistants.
   - `add n/Snowball p/98765432 e/snowball@example.com tele/@snowball t/fulltime c/CS1231S h/10`: Adds a teaching assistant named Snowball to the list.
   - `delete 3`: Deletes the 3rd teaching assistant shown in the current list.
   - `clear`: Deletes all teaching assistants.
   - `exit`: Exits the app.

6. Refer to the [Features](#features) section below for details on each command.

## Command Format

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g. `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `â€¦`â€‹ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]â€¦â€‹` can be used as `Â ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.

</div>

### Finding a Teaching Assistant: `find`

You can find specific teaching assistants using various search parameters.

Format: `find PREFIX KEYWORD [MORE_KEYWORDS]`

- You can search by name, course or free time, using the prefixes `n/`, `c/` or `d/ from/ to/` respectively.
- The name prefix `n/` allows for multiple keywords to be used, separated by spaces. e.g. `find n/Alex Bernice`.
- The course prefix `c/` and free time prefix `d/ from/ to/` allows for one keyword to be used, separated by spaces.
e.g. `find c/CS2103T` or `find d/1 from/10:00 to/12:00`.
- For the free time, all three prefixes `d/ from/ to/` must be present and all respective parameters need to be correctly given.
- The search is case-insensitive. e.g `alex` will match `Alex`, `cs1231s` will match `CS1231S`.
- Only full words will be matched e.g. `Alex` will not match `Alexis`, `cs1231` will not match `cs1231s`.
- You can apply multiple search filters to narrow down the search results, through including multiple filters in
one command.
- Teaching assistants matching all the search parameters will be returned.
- The search filters are applied to the original list of TAs, not the current view of TAs.

Examples:

- `find n/Alex` returns all teaching assistants with names containing `alex` (e.g. `Alex Yeoh`).
- `find c/cs1231s` returns all teaching assistants that are teaching `cs1231s`.
- `find d/1 from/10:00 to/12:00` returns all teaching assistants that are free on `Monday` from `10:00` to `12:00`.
- `find n/Alex c/cs1231s` returns all teaching assistants with names containing `alex` and are teaching `cs1231s`.
- `find c/cs2103t d/1 from/10:00 to/12:00` returns all teaching assistants that are teaching `cs2103t` and are free on `Monday` from `10:00` to `12:00`.

### Viewing Teaching Assistants: `list`

You can view the list of all teaching assistants in TAManager.

Format: `list`

</div>

### Updating Hours for All TAs in View: `hour`

You can add hours to all teaching assistants in the current list.

Format: `hour HOUR`

- This command update ths hour field for all TAs in view, by adding the `HOUR` value to their current values. This `HOUR` value can be both negative and positive.
- This command can be applied after the [`find`](#finding-a-teaching-assistant-find) command. e.g First type `find c/ CS2103T` will find all TAs with course
`CS2103T`, then type `hour 6` will add 6 hours to all `CS2103T` TAs only, other TAs will not be updated.
- The resulting working hour after updating should still be within range of 0-9999.

Examples:

- `hour 4` will add 4 hours to all TAs in the address book if you are at the default view of all TAs.
- `find c/CS1231S` then `hour 4` will add 4 hours to all `CS1231S` TAs and other TAs will not be affected.

### Editing free time for a Teaching Assistant: `editft`

You can edit the free time on a specified day for a specific teaching assistant.

Format: `editft INDEX d/DAY from/FROM to/TO`

- This command update ths time interval for the TA at the specified `INDEX` for weekday `DAY`.
- Weekday `DAY` should be between 1 and 5, inclusive, and `FROM` and `TO` should be in "HH:SS" format and `FROM` time should be before `TO` time.
